OpenCL raytracer
======================

An toy forward ray tracer which uses the GPU to ray trace a scene. Currently it supports, triangles meshes and spheres. All objects can have a single texture sourced from a texture atlas. The texture atlas includes a packing tool which constructs a KD tree using all the textures in the scene. This project includes a viewer which can be interacted with. Smalls scenes render at real time framerates.
